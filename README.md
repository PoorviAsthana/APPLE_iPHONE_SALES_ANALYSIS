# APPLE_iPHONE_SALES_ANALYSIS
This project analyzes a dataset of Apple iPhone models to uncover insights about customer satisfaction, sales trends, and pricing strategies. The dataset includes information such as product names, sales prices, discounts, customer ratings, RAM specifications, product URLs, and more. The primary objective is to understand how factors like price, product specifications, and customer feedback influence sales performance and consumer preferences.

## Project overview 
The data was processed and analyzed using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas, while visualizations were created with Plotly for clarity and interactivity. Bar charts were used to explore sales performance and ratings of the top-rated iPhones, while scatter plots visualized the correlation between sales price and customer ratings, as both are numerical variables. Insights revealed that lower-priced iPhones often receive better customer ratings, while premium models tend to have lower satisfaction levels despite their higher prices.

## Analysis 

Lower-priced models, such as the 'Apple iPhone SE (White, 64 GB)' and 'Apple iPhone XR (Black, 64 GB)', tend to receive significantly higher ratings, likely due to their ability to meet or exceed customer expectations while offering good value for money. On the other hand, premium models like the 'Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max (Pacific Blue, 128 GB)' and 'Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (Gold, 256 GB)' face more critical feedback, potentially due to heightened customer expectations at higher price points. This suggests that mid-range products are better positioned to balance affordability and feature offerings, leading to greater customer satisfaction. 
So Price and not only the advanced features, is one of the factors behind customer preference for a particular product over the other. 


## Conclusion 
The findings underscore the importance of competitive pricing in driving customer satisfaction and sales performance, especially for mid-range models like the 'Apple iPhone 12 (White, 128 GB)' and 'Apple iPhone 12 (Black, 128 GB)'. These models successfully cater to a broader audience by balancing price and features. In contrast, premium models, despite their advanced specifications, may struggle to justify their high prices, indicating a need for better differentiation or added value to align with customer expectations.
